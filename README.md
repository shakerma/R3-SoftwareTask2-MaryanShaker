This program/s uses a client/server system using tcp sockets in order to display the basic movements of a rover. Using numbers 0-5 and then mapping it to 0-255, a speed is calculated. Using the (w,a,s,d) keys a direction is set by indicating forward/reverse for each individual motor on each wheel (4 wheels). Ensure that the pygame window is open and that you indicate a speed before a direction. 

NOTE* sometimes the python is not able to recieve the keyboard input on the first try so it may take multiple clicks for it to recognize a key
